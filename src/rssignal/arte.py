"""Read ARTE: a show as a feed, and a programme's video behind its link.

ARTE items carry no enclosure at all — an item like
``.../fr/videos/127395-052-A/le-dessous-des-images/`` links to a player page and
the video itself lives behind a streaming manifest — so without this the whole
point of such a feed never reaches Signal.

How the video is found, and why not by scraping: the programme id is right there
in the link, and ARTE publishes a player API keyed by it that returns the same
manifest url the page's ``<video>`` element uses, plus the duration. That is two
small json/text fetches against a documented-shaped endpoint instead of parsing
a megabyte of rendered React that changes whenever the site is redesigned.

Which quality, and why it is chosen here rather than left to ffmpeg: the
manifest is a multi-variant HLS master offering the same programme from ~380x216
up to 1080p, and Signal refuses an attachment over 100 MB. ffmpeg's HLS demuxer
has no "biggest that fits" switch, so the master is parsed here, the size of each
rung is estimated from its advertised average bandwidth times the duration, and
the largest one expected to fit :data:`~rssignal.video.VIDEO_MAX_BYTES` is handed
to ffmpeg by program index. Streams are copied, never re-encoded: the rungs
already exist at sensible bitrates, and re-encoding would trade minutes of cpu
for nothing.

The dispatch that decides an item is ARTE's at all lives in
:mod:`rssignal.video`; this module only answers about ARTE.
