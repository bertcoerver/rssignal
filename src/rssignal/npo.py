"""Read NPO Start: a series as a feed, and an episode's video via Downloadgemist.

NPO publishes no RSS for its television, so following a series means reading the
series page itself. That is less fragile than it sounds: npo.nl is a Next.js
site, and every page carries the data it was rendered from in a
``<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">`` block — the series, its seasons, and every
episode of the season on show, each with its title, synopsis, artwork, duration
and the moment it was first broadcast. One request, and no HTML is parsed.

Two kinds of url are accepted, and they behave differently on purpose:

- ``https://npo.nl/start/serie/<series>/afleveringen`` (or just
  ``…/serie/<series>``) follows the **newest season**: the page shows that one
  first, so when season 3 starts the feed moves on with it.
- ``https://npo.nl/start/serie/<series>/afleveringen/seizoen-2`` stays on that
  season.

Each episode's link is its player page, ``https://npo.nl/start/afspelen/<slug>``,
and that is what :func:`~rssignal.video.is_video_item` recognises. The video is
fetched through :mod:`rssignal.downloadgemist`, which knows how to get it out of
NPO — and how to ask for it politely. The quality is chosen by the rule in
:mod:`rssignal.parts`: the fewest messages any quality fits in, then the best
quality that fits in that many.

The dispatch that decides an item is NPO's at all lives in :mod:`rssignal.video`;
this module only answers about NPO.
