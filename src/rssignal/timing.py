"""Optional wall-clock instrumentation, for finding out where a run goes.

Off unless ``rssignal run --timings`` turns it on, and when it is off a
:func:`step` costs one boolean check — so the call sites can sit permanently in
the hot paths (every ``signal-cli`` invocation, every ``yt-dlp`` invocation,
every feed's parse) without anyone paying for them.

Two kinds of output, both on stderr so they never mix into what a run actually
prints. Each step reports as it finishes, which is what you want while watching a
slow run go by; :func:`report` then totals them by category at the end, which is
what you want afterwards, because "38s in yt-dlp" is the sentence that decides
what to optimise and no individual line ever says it.

Steps are timed from several threads at once (see :func:`rssignal.run.run_feeds`),
so the concurrent total can exceed the wall-clock total. That is not a bug in the
arithmetic — it is the parallelism working, and comparing the two is the quickest
way to see how much of it there is.
