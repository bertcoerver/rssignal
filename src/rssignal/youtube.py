"""Follow a YouTube channel, and attach the video behind each of its items.

Discovery needs no API key and no scraping: YouTube publishes an Atom feed per
channel at ``/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC…`` carrying the last 15 uploads with
their real publication dates, titles, descriptions and thumbnails. So a channel
url is not parsed here at all — it is *rewritten* to that address and handed to
feedparser like any other feed, which is why filters, templates, extracts and
previews all work on a YouTube feed without knowing it is one.

A key would buy handle resolution, durations and backfill past 15 items. All
three are had here without one — the first two from yt-dlp's flat listings (see
:func:`youtube_feed_url` and :func:`with_durations`), the third from the
channel's uploads playlist (see :func:`archive_items`).

The backfill is only ever asked for by an episodic feed
(:mod:`rssignal.episodic`), because for anything else it would be a mistake: a
new group should open with the latest video, not a decade of them. A series is
the exception that wants the decade, one episode at a time.

Downloading is yt-dlp's job. It is run as a command rather than imported, for
the same reason ffmpeg is: ``subprocess.run`` gives the wall-clock timeout its
python API has no knob for, ``-J`` is a stable documented interface where that
api is not across yt-dlp's weekly releases, and a missing binary then reads the
same way a missing ffmpeg does. It is run signed out unless the environment says
otherwise (see :data:`COOKIES_ENV`), which is enough until YouTube decides an
address looks like a robot.

Which quality: the same "sharpest that fits" rule as ARTE, over a different
catalogue. YouTube serves video and audio separately above 360p, so a plan names
a pair of formats and yt-dlp muxes them; the sizes are usually exact rather than
estimated, because ``-J`` reports them.
