"""Fetch an NPO Start episode through downloadgemist.nl, gently.

NPO's own player hands out streams through a token dance that changes whenever
NPO feels like it. Downloadgemist is a free, hobby-run site that has kept up with
that for years, and behind its page is one small endpoint,
``core/hyperbridge.php``, that the page itself posts to:

1. ``get_streams`` with the episode url — a session id, the duration, and the
   qualities on offer (``1080p`` … ``360p``, and audio-only ``256Kbps`` /
   ``128Kbps``), each with a bitrate;
2. ``download_stream`` with one of those — either the file's url straight away,
   or the news that the site is fetching it into its own cache first;
3. ``get_cachestatus`` until that says ``100%``, then ``download_stream`` again
   for the url.

The session id is only half of a session: the other half is a PHP session
cookie set by the first answer, without which the second is a bare
``download_stream_empty_check``. So every call goes through one cookie jar, and
a session remembered from an earlier run — whose cookie died with it — is
looked up afresh before it is used.

It is somebody's free service, and rssignal runs a dozen times a day unattended,
so everything here leans towards asking less:

- **Only when there is something to send.** The listing comes from npo.nl (see
  :mod:`rssignal.npo`); this module is only reached for an episode that is new.
- **The site's own wait.** Its page makes a visitor wait as long as the episode
  lasts before the next download. The page enforces that in the browser, where a
  script would never see it, so it is kept here instead: no new download starts
  until the previous one's duration has passed. A run that meets the wait leaves
  the episode for a later run.
- **Backing off an episode that fails.** One hour, then two, four, … up to a
  day, without a single request in between. An episode that has failed for
  :data:`GIVE_UP_AFTER` is let go for good (:class:`~rssignal.video.VideoGone`)
  so it can't hold its feed's later episodes back forever.
- **One lookup per episode per few hours.** A dry run, and the resolve that
  precedes every real send, share one remembered ``get_streams`` answer.
- **Dry runs never start a download.** Only ``download_stream`` makes the site do
  work, and only :func:`fetch` calls it.

The waits and failures are kept in :mod:`rssignal.cache`. They decide *when* an
episode is asked for, never *whether* it is sent, which is what that file is
for; losing it costs at most one request sooner than planned.
