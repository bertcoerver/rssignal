"""Write tracebacks and run boundaries to a file, so an unattended run leaves
evidence.

A feed that fails prints one line on stderr — enough to see *that* something
went wrong, useless for working out *why*. When the run is a scheduled job or an
Apple Shortcut, stderr is usually thrown away, and the traceback with it: the
feed quietly stops arriving and there is nothing left to look at.

So every failure is also appended here, in full, with a timestamp. The file sits
next to ``.env`` — the working directory rssignal is already run from — and is
named ``rssignal.log``; ``RSSIGNAL_LOG`` moves it, and can be set in ``.env``
alongside everything else. Logging is best-effort in the strongest sense: a log
that can't be written must never be the reason a message isn't sent, so every
failure in here is swallowed.
